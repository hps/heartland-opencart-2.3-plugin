1.   Information Collection and Use

We collect information from various sources to provide our Services to you, to analyze and improve our Services, and to communicate with you (e.g., to send you updates or notices about our organization, or emails about products or services that we believe may be of interest to you). 
Information that you provide to us:  We collect information that you provide to us when you set up an account with us, use our Services, or communicate with us.  For example, if you register for an online account with us, then we may request your personal information (e.g., name, postal address, email address, DOB, telephone number, credit/debit card number, security code) or as applicable your business information, to complete the registration process, to process transactions, to send you information about our products, to send you promotional offers from third parties that we think may be of interest to you, or to otherwise provide our Services to you.  Similarly, if you request information from us through an online contact form (or if you email us), we collect the information you provide (e.g., name, telephone number, email address) so that we can respond to you.
 
Information collected from third parties:  We may collect information about you or your business from third parties in the course of providing our Services to you.  For example, we may obtain information from our merchant customersor we may collect information from a school or university about consumer/students to provide services to those consumer/student.
